**Exploring trends in Spotify’s most streamed tracks using R**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Spotify's most streamed songs using R, focusing on key insights like the influence of playlist inclusions, seasonal streaming trends, and the relationship between audio features and popularity. The analysis utilizes data visualization techniques to identify patterns in music consumption.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **R** (`tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `scales`, `colorspace`, `ggthemes`)
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Handling missing values, renaming columns, and converting data types.
- **Data Visualization**: Using `ggplot2` to create insightful charts.

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Playlist Influence on Streams**: Tracks featured in more playlists (Spotify, Apple, Deezer) tend to have higher streaming numbers.
- **Monthly Stream Trends**: Some months experience a spike in streams, possibly influenced by seasonality or major releases.
- **Artist Count Impact**: The number of artists on a track may affect its popularity.
- **Trends in Audio Features Over Time**: Analysis of danceability, energy, valence, and other features shows shifts in music trends.
- **Danceability vs. Streams**: Higher danceability scores often correlate with more streams.

## 📌 Visualizations
